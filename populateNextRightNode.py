# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

# struct Node {
#   int val;
#   Node *left;
#   Node *right;
#   Node *next;
# }
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, 
# just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
